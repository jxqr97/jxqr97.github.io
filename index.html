<p>I am a freshman with junior status at Eastern Washington University. I was in the Running Start Program and earned an Associates of Arts and Science degree along with my high school diploma during 11th and 12th grades. I am currently working on a bachelor&#39;s in Public Relations with a minor in English. I want to combine my passions and my degree after college and work for a non-profit organization.</p>

<p>My junior and senior years of high school I was awarded the Youth United Varsity Letter in Community Service. Since May of 2013, I have volunteered with a non-profit organization known as ONE. <a href="one.org">ONE</a> works to end extreme poverty and preventable disease through grassroots advocacy. I was the secretary of the Wenatchee Valley College ONE chapter for a year, before becoming the president. Last March I flew to Washington D.C. to attend the ONE Power Summit where I lobbied congress to increase spending for programs like GAVI, PEPEFAR, and the Global Fund.</p>

<p>Over last summer I stayed busy by working at my local Safeway, babysitting, and doing yardwork for an elderly neighbor.</p>
